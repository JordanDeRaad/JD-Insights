This website is for aerospace companies that want to contact either of us for marketing will have an optimized route to do so along with examples of portfolio. </p>

            <strong>Audience</strong>: Ideally the people who will be using this website are clients in the aerospace division that have a great product or concept but need help with the marketing side to get their product to sales and investment. The site is designed for people that don't need a lot of fancy UI but rather a streamlined way to get the information they want. Many people in the product or concept development side do not care for aesthetics or marketing but rather often have a singular focus on their product. We hope to show them that with our help they can reach investors and production faster. This website is designed for clients to see a little background and portfolio of the two marketing specialists.
