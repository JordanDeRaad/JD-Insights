    <h1><strong>Content Strategy</strong></h1>
        <p>
            Welcome Page: The first page will consist of a company name in the top left with a hamburger menu in top right of the same header region. This hamburger will consist of a list of content in the webpage and a button to jump the user to that specified area. The list items will be written out in top right in desktop view with same button functionality. These items consist of: Our Services, About Us, Our Work and Contact Us. The page ends with the start of a large photo centered in middle of page.
        </p>

        <p>
            What we offer: This section of the page starts with the large photo and below is a list stating in large text “What we offer:” with a list of a few items and lite description of said skill set. Below this will be a company idea, motto, or thought that pertains to what is offered as a whole and how it is relevant and needed.
        </p>

        <p>
            About us: This page consists of a new background color to offset first pages. At the top of this page is in large text the heading “About Us”  with two pictures and associated names of two people in company. I would prefer to link these two photos and name tags to each persons respective LinkedIn page. Under that is a brief description of our company, who we are as people and what we hope to achieve.
        </p>

        <p>
            Featured Work: This page now has a picture as a background preferably low exposure to offset last page being lighter in background color. This page will act as a living portfolio featuring best or favorite projects to show for each section listed above in what we offer. The page at the top will have the header Featured Work with project picture and what it is an example of as a name tag with it such as Web Development. This picture and name tag will act as a link to the webpage that has that featured project. The three items listed here will be Web Development, Graphic Design and Communications.

        </p>

        <p>
            Who we worked with: This page will share the same background color as the about us. This page is a way to reinforce the portfolio section above by showing the companies we have worked with in the past. This section will start with “Who we’ve worked with.”  in large text at the top. Below this will be a few logos of companies that we have worked with and the logos acting as buttons to redirect to said companies LinkedIn. Below these logos will be a couple names in bold of higher level people that we have worked with in the past with the same functionality to redirect to their LinkedIn. This acts as an informal recommendation being that if a person was so inclined they could contact the person on LinkedIn and ask their opinion on the company.
        </p>

        <p>
            Contact Us: Back to the color background of the original two pages. At the top in large text reads: “We’d love to work with you.”. Below is a standard Contact box with content lines to input things like Name, Email and the ability to write a message.
        </p>

        <p>
            Footer: This small section at the bottom of the page will have the same background color as the about us and Who we worked with. There will be icons centered in this footer containing the logos of social medias such as LinkedIn, Facebook, Github, Twitter, etc. These icons will act as buttons to redirect to associated sites for company.
        </p>
